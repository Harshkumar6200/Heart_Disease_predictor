# Heart Disease Predictor

This project is aimed at predicting heart disease using machine learning supervised learning classification algorithms.

## Overview

Heart disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Early detection and prediction of heart disease can significantly improve patient outcomes. In this project, we leverage machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various features.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle. It contains a collection of features such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc., along with the target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

## Algorithms Used

We have employed several supervised learning classification algorithms to build predictive models for heart disease detection. Some of the algorithms utilized include:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Usage

To utilize this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the models.
4. Provide input data to the trained model to predict the likelihood of heart disease.

## Results

The performance of each algorithm is evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are presented in the Jupyter notebook or Python script.

## Future Improvements

- Fine-tuning hyperparameters for better model performance.
- Exploring ensemble methods for model improvement.
- Incorporating feature engineering techniques to enhance model predictive power.
